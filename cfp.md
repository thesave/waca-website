## Overview

Cloud computing has become the cornerstone of modern application deployment, yet designing architectures that can adapt dynamically and correctly remains a significant challenge. The Workshop on Adaptable Cloud Architectures (WACA) provides a unique forum for researchers and practitioners to explore innovative approaches to cloud architecture adaptation.

The focus is on adaptation mechanisms that involve moving, adding, removing, and replacing software components, possibly modifying the provisioning of infrastructural resources in Cloud architectures. We are particularly interested in responses to changing user requirements, fluctuations in service load (desirable, e.g., increase of legit user requests, or undesirable, like DDoS attacks), infrastructure failures (e.g., machine outages, unreachable external services, or non-responsive internal components).

## Case Study: Adaptable TeaStore
To facilitate meaningful comparison of adaptation technologies, WACA will centre around a common case study based on an adaptable version of TeaStore, a well-known microservice reference application. We welcome reasonable variations on that specification.

We invite participants to submit papers showcasing technologies for modelling and implementing adaptation mechanisms based on the scenarios outlined in our case study. Artefacts complementing the paper are greatly appreciated.

## Submission Guidelines

The workshop itself does not have proceedings, and the submitted papers undergo a light-weight review.
